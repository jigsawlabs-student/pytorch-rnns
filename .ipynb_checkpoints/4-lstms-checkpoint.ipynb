    "LSTMs were explicitly designed to solve the vanishing gradient problem that we previously saw.  As mentioned, a vanishing gradient occurs when our gradient gets drastically smaller as we backpropagate further.  And RNNs are particularly susceptible to vanishing gradients as the hypothesis function repeatedly uses the same weight matrix $W_h$ to calculate the next hidden state.  Because of this, when backpropagating, we repeatedly multiply by $W_h$ for each time step earlier than $t$.  And this means that  when predicting the next word, $w_{t+1}$, our RNNs tend not to incorporate words from earlier timesteps, $w_{t-n}$.  \n",

    "As we'll see, with LSTMs, in addition to our hidden state, we'll have another object called a cell.  The hidden state is still responsible for capturing the context from the preceding words, as a sort of memory.  But this time, we'll have a cell to determine when we can remove something from our memory, add to our memory, or use a component in our memory.\n",
