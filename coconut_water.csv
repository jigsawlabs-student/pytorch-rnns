47837,47838,B004SRH2B6,A2GO0AIHB846UX,vinny,1,1,5,1313884800,WOW!!,I love this stuff!  Perfect blend of dark choc and coconut water.  I really like how smooth and refreshing this stuff is.  I am lactose intolerant so I can't drink choc milk but I think this stuff comes really close and it is better for you than cow's milk.  I look forward to buying case after case (=.
47838,47839,B004SRH2B6,AI1U3M3GW9X2W,Reformed Puritan,1,1,3,1311379200,It was a good deal but not likely to buy again,"I am from the Philippines, a country where there is an abundance of coconuts. I miss drinking coconut water which is something that you can easily get in my country by buying fresh coconut. So, I decided to try this product hoping to get the same satisfying taste that one would get from fresh coconut water. It turned out to be a disappointment. I do not doubt that this is indeed pure coconut water but it does have a sort of artificial flavor and smell to it. It might be just due to the plastic bottle itself."

Shreve ""Dorian Grey""",1,1,1,1310947200,You couldn't pay me to drink this!,"I recently started researching the benefits of drinking coconut water and consuming coconut oil daily because I have been trying to change my lifestyle from one of total nutricious abandon to healthy yet happy.  I absolutely love cooking with coconut oil, adding it to my morning coffee, using it as a skin moisturizer, anything and everything I possibly can use it for, and have been telling all of my friends and family.  I never really liked coconut so it did take a little bit to get used to the coconut taste with the oil.  The coconut water, however, was a little trickier.  I knew it would be very beneficial to hydrate myself with it after a hard workout so this is what I decided to do: I bought the Zico 14-ounce bottle of natural coconut water from my local supermarket and also bought a can of Goya's coconut water with pulp to see which one I would be able to drink.  I tried the Zico first thinking that since it's in a plastic bottle and so much more expensive it would be the natural winner.  I had chilled the coconut water in the fridge all day and when I opened the bottle and poured it into a glass I noticed a funny odor immediately.  After my first taste I was horrified at how terrible it was.  It's hard to describe, kind of plastic(y), bitter, and just nasty!  I've had coconut water/milk straight from a coconut before and it was delightful, Zico's does not taste a THING like that.  I know that this has no added sugar whereas Goya adds a little and Zico is ""supposedly"" pure but from concentrate.  I tried another sip thinking that it would grow on me, but no, not one little bit.  I then decided to open up the Goya, cautiously I tried it and I LOVED the coconut pulp and the taste immediately.  I know everyone has different tastes and I will admit that I was never a coconut lover before, but I figured since I have grown to love coconut oil I would be okay, but again, it may be an acquired taste.  My suggestion would be to try a can/bottle of different brands before you give up on drinking coconut water.  I am so glad that I didn't just buy the Zico because I would have signed off on even trying if I hadn't had the Goya right there to redeem itself."

Use this in my smoothies daily. I was getting this product in the smaller tetra pak, but after opening the package you couldn't shake it up without spilling it. This works much better and I've taken as long as a week to use the 33.8 size with no degradation in taste."

We were pretty excited to try it and let it chill in the refrigerator for several hours.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this beverage is truly disgusting.  It has a musty smell and it's difficult to even take a drink, something just seems off.  There's a foul flavor almost immediately while taking a drink which is followed by a deplorable aftertaste that is still wreaking havoc on my taste buds almost an hour later. My wife was able to take about two drinks and I struggled to drink half the bottle and could not stomach any more.<br /><br />We were very disappointed and will be returning this awful product."

By the way, it is also awesome as a mixer (or so i hear)."

Taste.<br /><br />In-depth Review:<br />I have been drinking Zico on and off for several years.  I thought it was the best of the Vita/ONE/etc varieties.  This was back before they were bought by Coca Cola and I was also buying the boxed version.<br /><br />I bought this new bottled version without reading the details and did not realize that this new form was from concentrate.  I did not pick up on a 'plastic"" taste that other reviewers had.  Rather, I just found the taste rather bland and seemingly watered down.  Who knew that it was from concentrate, and really was watered down!<br /><br />Something to also consider is whether the recent coconut craze will impact deforestation and local ecologies in developing countries where they come from.  It does not seem there are many studies done on this."

Recently Zico has sold out to Coca Cola and changed it's formula.  It now comes from concentrate and does not taste as good or fresh as it once did.  It does not taste terrible by any means, but if you want fresh natural coconut water, Vita Coco is really the best.  I find the best way now to enjoy these now, is to add a bit of fresh lime juice to the bottle and shake it.  Unless Zico goes back to using fresh juice, I will not buy this product again."

I give my children coconut water instead of fruit juices because it is so much more nutritious, and we also drink it as a rehydrant when we are ill instead of Gatorade or Pedialyte.  We have tried Zico, VitaCoco, and O.N.E. coconut water.  Zico is my favorite in terms of flavor diversity, and O.N.E. is my favorite in terms of packaging because each drinking box includes a small extendable straw to poke through the foil and use like a juice box- a VERY NICE non-spill feature for kids."

I tried it again, I tried it over ice, I tried it through a straw and nothing made it taste palatable.  If you haven't had coconut water before try one first before you buy a case.  My next step is going to try and mix it with a variety of liquors and see if I can stomach it.  Good luck!"

It has a clean refreshing taste that's not too overpowering. The 11oz boxes are what I normally drink.<br /><br />This product(14oz bottles) cannot compare to the box. The tast is absolutely horrible. Way too thick and sugary. It's almost as if they drained a bunch of old coconuts that had been sitting too long.

Since I can't get fresh coconut water where I live I order it from Amazon all the time...every few weeks or so.  My wife thought I was crazy at first, but she came to acquire a taste for coconut water and so I order some for her as well.  I loved the zico in the 11oz cartons.  I also like O.N.E; vita coco isn't bad either.  I figured that if I like zico in the 11oz carton, why not order the 14oz bottle?  Big mistake... unlike the product in the 11oz carton, this bottled stuff absolutely misrepresents authentic coconut water.  It has an after taste like sour milk.  I've tasted spoiled coconut water before in the caribbean, and even that tastes better than the new zico.  I have never felt so compelled to write a review about a product before.  I hope zico stops making their ""new"" product from concentrate, and gets back to what made their coconut water such a wonderful product in the first place.

Before stumbling on Zico, me and my girlfriend did numerous taste tastes with the other brands.  I will try to hunt down Harvest Bay Coconut Water.

The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell.<br /><br />How messed up is this?<br /><br />I can't believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That's crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm.  I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I've tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico.<br /><br />And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense.<br /><br />Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish!<br /><br />Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won't realize this has declined in flavor, so it's possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water.<br /><br />But I still miss old Zico.<br /><br />Note: I'm updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or  pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it's more drinkable. HTH.<br /><br />Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from amazon, brand Nature Factor. It's lovely. Lovely! So, at least I've found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH.<br /><br />2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes ""just like"" young Thai coconut water. That it's different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well, I've had unprocessed/raw young Thai coconut water. I don't recall it making me wanna spit it out. :) Just sayin'.<br /><br />3rd Update: Saw a couple online taste tests that gave props to Amy & Brian, also available here on amazon,  so will be trying that, too, now that I'm coconut water peregrinating. Might be worth a shot to google up coconut water taste tests and see what might suit you if you aren't anti-can. ADDENDUM: Tried it, loved the first batch in the 17.5 oz cans. I emailed the company and it's just CW (not from concentrate) and it's FLASH Pasteurized, so the nutrient count should be comparable to other coconut waters in the tetra paks (though A&B will likely show a higher carb/calorie count due to its sweetness). If you're carb-counting, you may wanna compare. If your main concern is ""natural"" and tasty-sweet, then consider Amy & Brian's. Really nice. Warning: Ordered a second batch in the 10 oz cans, and it tasted odd. Candy-sweet, like candy that melted in water. So, I can no longer recommend this brand due to flavor inconsistencies on that scale. Pity, as my first order was AMAZING. boohoo<br /><br />4th Update: Old Zico from Brazilian coconuts will be back in September. If you liked old Zico, WAIT, don't buy this one. Also, in a letter from the Zico Sales Director to a reviewer here (see discussion for details), the Zico rep said they'd increased sodium in this bottled Asian CW Zico to ""optimize"" hydration benefits. So, it's not just that it's from concentrate, it's ""optimized"" to make it saltier. By optimized, I don't mean they ADDED sodium, but used a mix of coconuts to ""optimize."" (Note: I know this cause the sales manager of Zico, Sherif P. Bates, replied to a discussion with a clarification, and this comment was posted under his own review post here. See discussion of comments under ""Todd O'Connor"". ) I don't know about y'all, but part of the reason why I like CW is that it's great to keep highish blood pressure normal due to its high Potassium. I do not need--and most Americans don't need--more sodium in their beverages or food. Maybe elite athletes sweating up a storm do, but not the rest of us who just exercise moderately (or not at all). So, there you go: New Zico. More sodium, less flavor.<br /><br />Note about reviews: Do check the reviewer's profile. If a reviewer is five-star (or four-star, even) raving about this product and has only reviews for Zico products and has no verified amazon purchase, find a grain of salt to toy with. That's no guarantee, naturally, but sometimes is a clue to...well, you can guess. (Note: See comments under the review by ""Todd O'Connor"" and under Alio ""Alio""s review for an explanation of how I learned about ONE fake review and Alio ""Alio"" confirming the fake identity.)"

The individual boxes also looked different -- the colors were off (flesh-tone instead of yellow), and the expiration date and batch info were printed differently. I can't recommend ordering in bulk from Amazon, even though it's so convenient and saves money. This isn't the first time I've experienced a bad batch -- as if the food company had sent a ""slightly imperfect"" batch to Amazon to get rid of it.

Every week, I would drive over to my local Whole Foods, pick up a few boxes of any brands I could find comparable flavors for and I always made sure to buy two or three at once to compare flavors.  Nothing ever really stuck taste-wise until I found this and it's absolutely delicious.  If you remember drinking Yoohoo as a kid, you'll recognize this taste immediately.  I don't know how Zico did it but this tastes identical to that chocolately smooth goodness of my youth but, you know, much healthier.  I will say though, it tastes much better cold -- as the bottle says -- but that doesn't mean it's bad when it's warm, it's just better cold, that's all.<br /><br />I also carry these to the gym and when I run obstacle course races, especially if I'm unsure of what the post-race rehydration drink will be (typically Powerade or Gatorade).  I honestly didn't think much to Zico's claims on their site and the bottle that it supports ""rapid hydration"", whatever that is, but I do know that its huge amounts of potassium have kept me from bonking after a race to maintaining my perk.  I typically pound one of these and one to two bananas or Larabars post-race and I've certainly jump started the recovery process better than I ever did with sports drinks or water alone.  After I'm done in the gym, I chug some Zico to cool off and wash the taste of electrolyte-flavored water out of my mouth.  I can definitely tell a difference in my moods after racing or lifting when I drink some coconut water versus when I'm just drinking water alone.<br /><br />For me, no brand can touch Zico in the taste department on this one."

I have tried this variety (Zico) and the Vita Coco brand, which were comparable in price and quality.  Both were delicious, though only about half the people here at the office that tried it shared that opinion.  So young coconut water may be something of a specific taste.<br /><br />I'm a fan of coconut water (both Zico and Vita Coco) because they are very refreshing when served cold.  As they claim, it does naturally contain some of the same compounds found in sports drinks that are supposed to speed hydration (take that with a grain of salt...water hydrates just as well as anything).<br /><br />But best of all - 34 fl. ounces (1L) of (Zico/Vita Coco) coconut water = ~173 calories.  One can of coke (12 fl. oz) = ~143 calories (according to the label, other sites claim more).  The cocount water also has a fair amount of potassium and a small amount of other vitamins, whereas cola has almost no nutritional value at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

This is chocolate flavored.  Well , anything chocolate in my book is a winner.  the product arrived fast, and was packaged very well. I put a few in the refrigerator and in a couple hours, I tried one.  It didn't gag, or spit it out. It actually has a once taste to it.  Kinda like watered down chocolate milk.  Didn't taste any coconut flavor, just chocolate.  It filled me up, and seemed to make me have a little energy,  I plan on using these as after workout drinks, or even after too much  indulging in the wine, I think these would help!  Lol.

Zico is more like fresh-squeezed.<br /><br />The only reason we had purchased the Vita Coco brand initially was that it seemed more available in local stores (as a backup, we love you Amazon and would never ever go to the store if we didn't have to).<br /><br />Zico packaging was the same as VC in my opinion and has no issues. We ordered the 33.8-ounce 6-pack to make the cost much less comparable to VC's 12-pack of 11.1-ounce cartons, and that seems to have been a happy accident as a space-saver (for us) in the refrigerator.

After about the first sip of the plain unadulterated coconut water I got at the grocery store I knew it and I were not going to be friends. I couldn't even force myself to finish the carton. I could not figure out why everyone was so excited about it and decided it just wasn't for me. Then, one day earlier this month I saw Zico Chocolate in the cold case at a convenience store, sandwiched between juices and sports drinks. I was hesitant to buy it considering my previous experience with coconut water but the lure of chocolate was too much. I am so glad that I decided to go for it! Zico Chocolate could not be more different from plain coconut water. The weird (almost like bad molasses) flavor I found so unappealing in the plain was missing completely from the Zico Chocolate. Because they added some coconut cream it is ever so mildly creamy and the chocolate is nice and rich like semisweet dark chocolate. Just like plain coconut water it has an enticing naturally occurring nutrient content including some calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, vitamin A, and phosphorus. The only nutritional downside is that there is some added sugar, bringing the total sugar for one 14 oz bottle up to 18 grams. However, for me drinking a Zico Chocolate is often a replacement for either a dessert or a sweetened iced tea so I'm not really ingesting any more sugar than I normally would be. If you don't mind the added sugar and/or haven't been pleased with the taste of other coconut water I highly recommend trying Zico Chocolate.<br /><br />This last bit is about buying from Amazon and not about the product itself. This is the first time I've bought this particular product from Amazon and I am very happy with the purchase. It cost me significantly less per bottle to have it shipped by the case from Amazon using subscribe & save than it costs to buy in any store near me ($.75 - $1.00 less per bottle). Although buying it this way made it ineligible for Prime 2-day shipping, the box still arrived here the day after I ordered it and in perfect condition; that is good customer service!!!"

Nothing beats fresh young coconut water straight out of the coconut, but this comes close to the flavor.  Don't waste your time on canned coconunt water - it's awful IMO.  Zico has a lower sugar content than the other brands I've sampled (14gms/serving vs. 20gms/seving).  It is isotonic, high in potassium and rich in electrolytes.  You can practically live on it!  If you have an upset stomach, it settles it immediately.  I have an aunt who was hospitalized and unable to eat.  Her potassium levels were very low.  She was able to drink this and keep it down.  It helped improve her postassium levels and settled her nausea.  A friend of my  9 yrs. old son's had a ""tummy"" ache while we were at the state fair.

The packaging was great you don't need a straw to drink right away. I bought the bottled zico and after my first drink the taste of plastic container was very evident.

Though no packaged coconut water comes close to the taste of fresh-from-a-tender-coconut water, Zico is the best one I have found so far (have tried many others sold here at Amazon and elsewhere; Vita Coco is the 2nd best in my opinion). Coconut water is awesome in terms of being nutritious and refreshing, and sodas of course don't hold a candle to it. I have tried both the Zico 'natural' (as in no added flavor) and the Zico mango flavored, and must say that the mango flavored one wins hands down. The regular one has a slightly 'cooked' or 'boiled' taste to it (as packaged coconut water is pasteurized), and maybe the mango flavor covers that in the other one. Tastes great whether cool or cold; probably better the colder it is. The mango flavor is very delicate, and does not take away from the coconut water itself, somehow enhancing it and making it even more delicious. Plus, the first time I got this the price was fantastic, 8 dollars off from the usual 24 due to a lightning deal, making this even sweeter (no pun intended, the coconut water has only a touch of sweetness, no added sugar - just the right, natural amount).

While I'm disappointed that you do not like the taste of the new ZICO in a bottle, I did want to please clarify a few misconceptions that I believe may exist.<br /><br />* Rationale - The reason for launching the bottle was pure and simply consumer demand.  Our active lifestyle consumers wanted a packaging solution that allowed them to enjoy ZICO coconut water in a way that met their needs.  For a number of reasons, tetra packaging was not that solution so we came up with the bottle as a result.<br />* Taste - You are correct that the new ZICO taste is different from the product in the Tetra, however that is due to the fact that for the bottle, we are using a blend of coconuts from around the world, rather than simply coconuts from Brazil, as we do in the carton.  This blend was selected for its lighter taste, it's naturally lower caloric content (20% fewer calories per oz.) and it's naturally increased sodium levels to optimize hydration benefits.  The taste you are experiencing is intentionally different, but it is due to the blend of coconuts we are using rather than the packaging.  The good news is that we are continuing to manufacture ZICO in a carton so that consumers like yourself can choose which taste and nutritional profile they prefer.<br />* Packaging - Contrary to what you would expect, the new ZICO bottle actually has a lower carbon footprint than the tetra pack:<br />o Tetra packaging is only recyclable in 40% of the U.S. and today less than 1% is actually recycled.  To do so is extremely energy intensive, as it requires separating the multiple layers of materials that make up the carton.<br />o The ZICO bottle is #2 recyclable, accepted in almost all curbside recycling programs nationwide and currently 40% of all HDPE bottles are recycled in the US<br />o ZICO bottles are made domestically, which means we have reduced the impact (fuel, energy, pollution) of shipping full-strength water and packaging materials around the globe<br />At ZICO we take our impact on the environment very seriously, so I would like to reassure you that our decision to launch the bottle was entered into with the environment top-of-mind and this decision was embraced fully by retail partners like Whole Foods, who understand the environmental realities of tetra vs. HDPE, despite consumer misperceptions.<br /><br />I apologize for the long response to your inquiry, however you clearly have a passionate viewpoint on the new bottle, so I wanted to make sure that we provided you with the proper insights and facts to be able to make your decision.  And regardless of your final decision, I would like to thank you again for taking the time to write to us, as it's feedback like yours that helps us ensure we stay true to what consumers would like.""<br /><br />Felt a lot better with a better understanding. The new natural is getting addicting. my body is craving this stuff after a workout."

I took a free bottle of Zico after I had completed my half-marathon and drank it at home; within several minutes, I had a case of diarrhea.  Then it struck me: I realized that this may be the reason I wanted to take a dump during the race.  After I had run 10 miles at 8 minutes/mile, I was getting dehydrated and picked up 2 cups of Zico coconut water.  Within several minutes, I wanted to take a dump BADLY.  But I forced myself to continue running for the following reasons: I only had 3 miles to go, it's my rule to NEVER stop to use the bathroom during a race, and I had trained several months for the race (training hard on hilly terrain for this particular event).  With me painfully pinching my buttocks the last 3 miles, I slowed down to over 9 minutes/mile while so many people were passing me.  I couldn't sprint the last stretch, I was just trying to hang in there despite the hardship of not letting ""it"" out.  After I finished, I went straight to the portable toilets to relieve myself... which took 15 minutes; this would have been devastating had I used the bathroom during the race, but certainly not as bad had I lost control of my bowels during the race.  I could have finished with an awesome time had I not had wanted to take a dump during the race.  Once I found that Zico was the cause of my diarrhea, I did an internet search on ""coconut water laxative"" and an ABUNDANT number articles of how coconut water is such a great natural LAXATIVE.  The bottom line is this: Zico coconut water will help you ""run"", but in the wrong way.  You'll be putting much more muscle power into your gluttonous maximus than your legs while racing.  Oh, and one more thing... Zico doesn't even taste good.  >:p"

It don't taste like a real coconut and I'm glad it don't. Real coconut taste is not as sweet and it a bit bitter. Wish price would be better."

The new blend that they use reminds me more of the Thai coconuts I grew up drinking and the bottles make it so convenient for me to carry around with me since I'm always on the go.<br /><br />The concentrate does not bother me at all, as after doing some research online, my negative opinion of the term has completely been changed. It doesn't mean that it's not natural or that anything is added - it simply means that they have taken the water out and shipped over just the goodness (which by the way, is WAY more environmentally friendly than shipping water across the world!!) and added back the water through reverse osmosis. Hey, if you're a POM or Sambazon fan - then you know that they are from concentrate too!<br /><br />The flavors are super yummy too! I'm in love with the Pomberry. Another thumbs up about the bottle? It's 100% recyclable!! YUP! 100% - including the cap! There aren't too many products out there where you can recylce the cap. Also, it's made from number 2 plastic which means that it's made from recylced materials. I used to find it hard to recylce the carton packaging, as not many facilities knew how to recycle it since it's made from so many different materials.<br /><br />Two thumbs up on the new packaging and the new taste profile!!

I got the two cases I ordered today and it tastes terrible! It actually tastes like plastic or some sort of chemical/pesticide. Even after chilling it and pouring into a glass it is still not drinkable. Do not waste your money on this if you like real coconut water. Try the O.N.E. coconut water instead. It was my second favorite until now and I will never buy another bottle of ZICO.<br /><br />Who cares if you can recycle the bottle if the product is not fit to drink? What a waste of $60!

He had tried the usual ""sport drinks"", but still got the cramps.  He heard about coconut water and wanted to try it, and picked up a bottle or two here and there of the various brands and liked Zico best.  I was given a coupon at another store that had it, so I ordered 2 cases.  He made short work of them (the weather was better then) and they made short work of the cramps, but I couldn't find it again at that same store.  Amazon to the rescue!<br /><br />This stuff really works for the cramp-prone, but people differ as to which one tastes best.  My husband likes this one.<br /><br />10/03/11:  Zico has recently brought out a chocolate flavor, which is so yummy even I like it.  My husband rode the last 3 days of the B.R.A.T.

Honestly, I absolutely LOVE, LOVE the nuttier flavor and can't drink enough of it. It's significanlty more drinkable for someone who's never had coconut water a part of their daily diet.  The original flavors are great, Mango and Passion. I first fell in love with ZICO by drinking the Passion, then I started to wanting less flavor and transitioned to Mango. But never full latched onto natural. Though, I've been wanting to make the switch.<br /><br />With the bottle now, it's what I've been waiting for. I LOVE IT!!! It's amazing to just chug it cold after a hard work out, and you know it's packed with natural electrolytes, potassium, and so much more. Great for your skin and internal system. Overall it's just an amazing beverage. I can't stop raving about it to all my friends, family, and fellow athletes. Currently, I'm training for an aquathon, and I don't know how I did it before. But there's no going back now.<br /><br />My other favorite in the bottle is Lima Citron. It's so tasty. It just brings me back to my childhood since the smell reminds me of Fruit Loops! And it taste just as yummy, but sooo much better for you.<br /><br />Look I'll be honest. The bottle isn't tetra, and it's not meant to be. Tetra is great in it's own right, but this new line has proposed another fabulous alternative to all those who love coconut water but needed more versility with the on-go lifestyle. So credit is due for that.<br /><br />I'm super stoked that ZICO gave us consumers two options: tetra and bottle. And I'm going to enjoy both fully!! It's just wonderful to switch up the flavors. Somedays I'll have Natural others Mango. When I'm training, it'll be the bottle. At the office, it'll be the tetra. Any way you look at it, ZICO is helping me be healthier whether it's in the bottle or tetra.  It's just a personal preference at this point. So try it and be your own judge.<br /><br />Besides when I found out that the bottle is actually more environmentally friendly, I was happily surprised. Tetra isn't recylced by many plants nationally. 30% of the bottle is made from recylced materials and is 100% recylcable(including the cap - unlike water bottles). Personally, this is important to me.<br /><br />And I agree with the other reviewers with regards to the concentrate and the decrease of their carbon foot print. It's true and relevant.<br /><br />ZICO, thank you for the amazing products you continue to give to us, and most importantly thank you for promoting a healthier, more hydrated lifestyle in a fabulously tasty way via bottle or tetra. Here's to you in breaking the mold and trying to help more people with your new bottle while still keeping tetra for those who've become so loyal. Hat's off!!! You've now acquired another fan for life!!!<br /><br />Cheers!!!!<br /><br />P.S. ZICO is still amazing."

If you're being frugal, this product works fine, but personally, I'd spare the extra few bucks and go with Vita Coco or One."

Its really refreshing and more hydrating than Gatorade (which my kids even my kids have abandoned for Zico!) I've tried some other brands but Zico blows them out of the water, literally!<br /><br />I've told all of my spinning students about it and they agree that Zico is the best one out there because of its great taste and now its even better because its in a bottle!

I doesn't taste like plastic at all and it's much more convenient then the Terapack. I tried Vita Coco when I had a coconut water craving (because I couldn't find Zico) and almost puked! Vita Coco smelled like fermented lactose mixed with the scent of Original Chapstick and if someone handed it to me in a blank glass, I would have NEVER identified it as coconut water.

There are other things out there that are better quality and less expensive and more specific for what you are looking for.

The potassium content was way over the sodium, which was good. It was higher in sugar than I like. The protein and fat content was negligible. So, it's a good drink. Very tasty.

It gets industrialized of course! This tastes like some number crunchers worked on lowering the price per unit to boost the profit margin and marketers worked on bottle material and bottle shape with a test group until it scored a good percentile and voila, you get a processed liquid in a plastic bottle. One of their biggest problems with all of this was that their original customers' palates had only experienced pure CW, so we all knew better. We were used to the good stuff and then our dealer got greedy and cut our coke, I mean our coconut water, and they lost alot of buyers to others dealing the pure stuff. Now I buy ZICO in the 33.8oz tetrapacks. It's the pure stuff.<br /><br />Knowing that ZICO sometimes reads these reviews I'm wondering out loud here if someone inside ZICO, with a sense of taste, just HAS to be saying ""I told you so"" ever since this version was released. If so many customers hate it you just know that someone inside ZICO must have hated it too. Whoever that discerning person is has since been acknowledged I'm sure..."

Zico tastes nothing like any coconut water I've ever had! Its completely flat and whatever taste it does have is almost intangible. Now I really wanted to like it having read some really good reviews (here actually!) and so was thoroughly disappointed. I kept trying to like it, trying it at different temperatures - super chilled, room temp, mildly chilled but still it tasted like nothing. THEN, I read the label - MADE FROM CONCENTRATE! This makes a BIG difference! The flatness of the taste now totally makes sense! I would not recommend this product at all. Seeing all the wildly differing opinions I think either it's a very personal thing or the manufacturers are writing their own reviews:) but so far I've quite like vita coco and Amy and Brian's. Vita Coco to me tastes very genuine but is a little less sweet than Amy and Brian. Amy and Brian's is delicious, it's incredibly sweet despite having no added sugar. Mind you none of these are actually low cal - they still have a good amount of natural sugar. But coming back to Zico, I think of all the natural coconut waters I've had, this is the worst."

So she tasted all of them, while giving me feedback (her least favorites being the Lima Citron and Natural bc she likes sweeter drinks than I). She said the Mango tasted more like coconut, which is not at all what I recalled. I tasted it, and I've got to say- this one is now my favorite. The mango flavor is subtle, the coconut flavor more pronounced.<br />I agree with previous reviewers. The old version is almost unpalatable (sickeningly sweet and pungent), and I could barely finish the bottle (actually it was in the cardboard/ paper container).<br />For those of you who've tried and disliked the Mango flavor, I'd suggest giving it another shot in a few weeks.

All of them contain one ingredient:100% natural coconut water. However, ZICO is the ONLY coconut water that is 1) Made from concentrate and 2) contains added ""Natural ingredients"". At trader joes, Zico costs about 2 bucks, which is the same price for C20 coconut water and Vitacoco which both do NOT have ""natural flavors"" added to it and are NOT from concentrate. The packaging advertises ""30 percent less sugar""...well that's because they took out 30% of the coconut water and replaced it with water. It was so nasty that they had to add ""natural flavors"". Do not buy this brand. When I was a little kid I used to suck on my water squirt guns and the taste of this coconut water resembles that-like plastic/water with a small hint of coconut water. The other brands are so much better and are actually natural. For the same price, go get a coconut water that is not from concentrate. My favorite is C20."

I opened the last case and the top looked funny,<br />but i poured a drink and took a drink , it tasted funny , not like the<br />others.later that day got real sick. Looking at the other tops, i saw<br />they were not in tack. and poured out the products in that case, as<br />they were all alike, (I have the 6 containers still and if I could send<br />them back I would for a refund.

After buying this I realized that some companies (and people) will do anything for a profit - like rip off their fellow man.  Here's how....<br /><br />Zico used to be real 100% coconut water. Now, after conglomerate Coca Cola bought them, it's dumbed down: it's now part coconut water (juice) watered down with H2O (water) with unspecified ""natural flavor"" added so you are tricked into thinking your coconut water hasn't just been seriously diluted. Why?  It's cheaper!  They save money by cutting it with plain water.  But it wouldn't taste the same, right?  That's where the flavoring comes in.... To trick you.<br /><br />Zico wont actually specify how much they water it down but you can guesstimate simply by their ads.... They brag this product has 30% less sugar than other brands.  Ok, that means this is likely a 70% coconut to 30% water mixture.  Do you want 100% coconut water or 70% coconut water in your bottle?<br /><br />This isn't the ratio nature intended by the way.  And if that means 30% less sugar (ie 30% less actual coconut water in the bottle) it also means 30% less electrolytes than you should be getting from a 100% product too.  It's just logic."

When I was in Thailand in 2005 I had a fresh one sliced open and could barely put it down.  Years later, by forcing myself to love it, I now am addicted.  You can learn to love this stuff.  And with its many muscle revitalizing and cholesterol healing properties, you can too.  Coconut water reportedly has a unique long-form cholesterol that helps regulate bad cholesterol, among other healing properties.  Not a low calorie food, are you kidding?  This is nothing compared to juice, tea, soda, etc..  The only natural drinks that have it beat on calories are black coffee and tea. This product is not from concentrate and tastes delicious.  If I could afford it, I would only need this one drink for life and I'd be happy."

However, I went to re-order the same exact item and was shocked to see that the price of a 12 pack jumped from $21.51 to $53.95!<br /><br />Come on, Amazon, really?

We decided to stick with Zico but it doesn't contain extra sugar or other fruit juices like some of the other ones that we've tried. What I also like is the fact that I can subscribe for the product through amazon to get the case sent to me every month! This definitely takes the hassle out of going to the store to get it and I think it's set at a great price point. We've been going through our case so fast (we're pretty active) that I've increased my case count to 2 every month!

If you ever tried Taste Nirvana coconut water before, Zico pales in comparison. Zico is less sweet and saltier version of Taste Nirvana coconut water. I've also tried VitaCoco. Compared to VitaCoco, Zico tastes creamier than VitaCoco and doesn't have that sour taste.<br /><br />However, in all honesty, Zico tastes like skim milk and nothing like real coconut water from a fresh coconut."

The mango flavor really jumped out at me because I love mangoes and thought coconut and mangoes would perfectly compliment each other. Unfortunately, the Zico drinks with ""natural mango flavor"" taste like someone dropped a mango flavored hard candy into my Zico drink. It's not terrible, but that's definitely NOT the refreshing flavor I was hoping for, especially after a hard workout! I think I can manage to power through the remaining 11 drink boxes I bought, but I won't be wasting my money on this drink again."

I am 6 months preg and started feeling dizzy/lightheaded.  OB said to drink more liquids but I still have morning sickness and liquids before 10 AM dont stay down.  I tried several different coconut waters and found this Zico chocolate, ONE with guava and Naked plain to be the three I prefer.  This Zico chocolate is my favorite!  It is good in the morning when milk is too heavy and fruit juice is unappealing.  I feel much better after a couple of weeks drinking 1-2 coconut waters a day in addition to as much regular water I can stomach.

It was interesting to me that, what with the free shipping, this was more than a dollar a bottle cheaper than I buy it for in the grocery store.  It came double boxed.  That is, there was a compartmentalized container with the liter bottles carefully packed within, this box was surrounded by air bag packaging and packed within a larger sturdy cardboard container.  Great packaging.<br />  My wife uses this product and her comments follow:  As to the taste.  I found I prefer Zico over the other brands as it doesn't appear to have any ""hidden"" sugar added to hype up the taste.  My previous brand, Vita Coco,  did not declare added sugar, but it did leave that sugared drink after taste in my mouth and was noticeably sweeter.<br />  I cannot say that I particularly like the taste of coconut water, but it has the nutritional potassium I need in my diet, and is easier to keep around than bananas and has less calories."
